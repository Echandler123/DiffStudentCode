The main idea discussed was a tabulation approach with a 2d array using the 2 string as axes. Then letters are added to the array and previous letter are used to solve the problem. |

| Feb 27  |   2:00-3:00   | I have almost finished the longestsharedsubstring method. I have fixed a few conceptual errors I had, but I still have some errors in my implementation of it. Before we went over the theory I had my arr set up as an array of strings but on confused that with the fact that the dimensions would be the size of hte two docs which are strings. I also was confused due to the comparison being made using charat but then just realized that would be fine because the dimensions of the array are the same as the two lengths of the docs. I still have at least one error in my implementation though as I have an index out of bounds when I run the tester. |

I also found a small improvement by using math.max to get the maximum value from the cell to the left or above instead of using an if statement which is what I originally had. Now I just need to add comments and make any style changes needed. |
